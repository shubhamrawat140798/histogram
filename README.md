# histogram

program that reads a list of exam scores from the file MidtermScores.
txt (which contains one score per line) and then displays a histogram of those numbers, 
divided into the ranges 0–9, 10–19, 20–29, and so forth, up to the range containing only 
the value 100. 
If, for example, MidtermScores.txt contains the data shown in the right margin, your 
program should then be able to generate a histogram that looks as much as possible like 
the following sample run:

00-09 : 

10-19 : *

20-29 : *

30-39 : **

40-49 : *

50-59 : *****

60-69 : *******

70-79 : *****************

80-89 : ******

90-99 : **********

100 : *
